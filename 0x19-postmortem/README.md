Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM on February 5th, 2024 (UTC).
Impact: The outage affected the availability and functionality of our web application, resulting in a 30% decrease in user engagement during the outage period.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection issue caused by a misconfiguration in the database settings.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in error rates and a decline in system performance.
10:05 AM: Engineers noticed the degraded performance and began investigating potential causes.
Actions Taken: The team initially investigated the application servers and network infrastructure for any anomalies. Assumptions were made that a recent deployment might have introduced a bug or that there was a sudden surge in traffic causing the slowdown.
Misleading Investigation: Some initial efforts focused on analyzing recent code changes and deployment logs, leading to no conclusive findings. Additionally, there was a brief consideration that a network issue might be the culprit.
Escalation: The incident was escalated to the database administration team and senior system administrators for further investigation and resolution.
Incident Resolution: Upon closer examination, it was discovered that the database server was experiencing a high number of connection timeouts due to misconfigured connection pool settings.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings, leading to a bottleneck in connection handling and eventual timeouts.
Resolution: The issue was promptly resolved by adjusting the database connection pool settings to accommodate the increased demand and prevent future timeouts.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated monitoring for database connection pool health and performance metrics.
Enhance deployment procedures to include thorough testing of database configuration changes.
Conduct regular audits of system configurations to identify and address potential misconfigurations proactively.
Tasks:
Update database connection pool settings to optimize performance and prevent timeouts.
Implement automated alerts for abnormal database connection behavior.
Conduct a thorough review of deployment processes to ensure configuration changes are properly tested and validated.
Schedule regular maintenance tasks to review and optimize system configurations for performance and reliability.
